My next leg of the journey takes me through Quebec, the French speaking province of Canada. While Ottawa had bilingual signs and services in both English and French, the Quebec cities of Montreal and Quebec City has everything primarily in French. Thanks to the long history of the province spanning centuries well before the Canadian Dominion, there is an incredibly unique culture that's a refreshing change from the rest of English Canada.....

Also I'm aware about not using the accented letters for French words. ... Anyways>

# Montreal

# Day 0 - New Orleans
Simply an excellent ride from Ottawa to Montreal. While slightly more expensive than Flixbus, New Orleans buses have comfier seats, nicer interiors, more legroom (enough for a footrest), and wasn't booked full so I didn't need to squeeze next to someone else. Plus, I manage to find the coupon code: ECONO50, for a casual 50% off my tickets lol. It doesn't give me their reward points when applied, but I wasn't planning to bus frequently anyways.

TODO everything else lol

# Day 1 - Central Montreal
After developing a fear of biking off a given trail, I decided to start easy and take a straight, express route (REV route) to Old Montreal. They are marked in blue and are intended as big boy bike lanes to push lots of people through them. Conveniently there happens to be one behind my hostel, just under the train bridge and pass the 4 lane into giant fucking highway entrance. I end up walking my bike to the starting point.

When I arrived to Old Montreal, the Basilique Notre-Dame had just open for visiting. Many of the major attractions offer student discount just by showing id, so I got to visit for just $14. Another fact, the Basilique is giant (but not the biggest in Montreal), with such intricate interior that I'm only to demonstrate with my high-res images.

While I was there I might as well see Old Montreal, which was barren at 10am on a monday. Honestly, only a few streets were worth checking out, as most areas just felt empty or even abandoned. Sometimes bordering depressing, knowing that the historic architecture is just that, historic and long bulldozed everywhere else. There was this nice street with lines of shops and checkered flag for an upcoming event.

Nearby is the old harbor, a nice walking and biking area with famous landmarks like .... TODO

TODO Chinatown, st lawrance, mount plateau TODO

I've always been a Canadian, so I've already had poutine in my hometown. From Costco slop and overpriced bar scran, my previous favorite poutine came out of a shipping container in Radium, BC. I use to think poutine as heavy though, something that makes me sick of it the more I eat. BUT! The poutine at La Banquise was just c'est excellent! Like holy, I can't think of another dish where after eating til I was sick full that I wanted to order even more! Gravy was deliciously savory with a hint of sweetness, and the cheese curds melted in my mouth with delight. With a restaurant with such prestige, I had to order a deluxe poutine. Mine came with smoked meat, bacon, sausages, and pepperoni, all of it prepared excellently.

La Banquise is such a easy recommendation to give. Great food, reasonable price, and next to the popular Le Plateau-Mont-Royal. If you plan to try it yourself just be prepared for long lines. For reference, today was a monday and raining, and yet the place was almost full. Busy days could hae you waiting hours for a spot.

Man biking in Montreal is such a bipolar experience. My ride from La Banquise back to the hostel happens to be along a protected bike lane, and it was just plain fun. Never seen another North American city with bike traffic so long and intense as here. The feeling of straight, uninterrupted routes is like no other. Didn't even feel my leg injury, as the Achilles tendonitis only affected the lower leg/ankle, and not the hamstring/calf actually used in biking.

But there always have to be caveats. [The latter half of this video from Not Just Bikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yDtLv-7xZ4) summarizes my feelings as well (the metro/buses were on strike so I didn't ride them), that being

1. The moment you deviate from the designated bike route, you're often thrown onto a car filled street and have to fend for yourself. As expansive of Montreal's bike network is, a closer look reveals tons of stranded blocks and disjoint networks stitched together in a confusing manner. Multiple construction projects covering the bike lane either diverts to a makeshift bike/pedestrian lane, or just has us going down the street with the cars. 
2. Downtown is chaotic for both bikers and drivers. I saw people jumping the red lights, bikers edging incoming cars to cross faster, and cars inching towards columns of people on turns trying to cut through the crowds. It's a disaster waiting to happen, and I wish I bought a helmet in case I became said disaster.

## Day 2 - Canal and A... Market


## Day 3 - Little Italy and Botanical Garden
For my third day, I wanted to hit the far away attractions of Little Italy in the west, and the Botanical Garden in the north. Now with my left calf starting to cramp, and since the metro is still on strike, I make use of my monthly Bixi pass to bike 2+ hours all across Montreal. I'd clearly never experienced real city biking until now, because the commitment, thrill, and human spirit it takes to travel 30+ km by shear muscle power is insurmountable to the average car driver, nevertheless the daily commute by bike gigachads.

Starting with a brisk 44 minute ride to Little Italy, I arrive around 10am to a quiet neighborhood, with places other than the Jean Talon Market still preparing to open shop. Speaking of the market, Jean Talon is a semi-open venue filled with produce, flowers, and food stands. It's a lovely place to get lost among the shops, especially so early when the crowds are still small.

On the way out, I stumble and bonded together with some fellow travelers trying some local oysters. There are probably three main dishes to try in Quebec: poutine, duck, and oysters, and this oyster stand selling every variety of canadian oysters for ~$2.50 each is an incredible bargain for such a great snack! I didn't even know oysters could have such different flavours depending on the location, from salty to creamy and everything else in between.

Montreal's Little Italy was by far the nicest out of Toronto's and Ottawa's. In both size, beauty, and variety of shops. There are quite a lot of extra luxurious dinning spots, but some hidden gems around the market and off the main streets. Only real complaint was the main road cutting through the neighborhood gets really busy and annoyingly loud, so sitting on a street patio became somewhat uncomfortable. At least I got some good Ravioli.

img of Ravioli

Next up was the Botanical Garden, about 30 minutes away by bike. There are many themed sub sections within the area, each with a unique setting of greenery to check out. Pictures can't exhibit the beauty and serenity of actually being present among the nature, only visiting in person will do the place justice, but I'll post my images anyways

Right across the garden is the Biodome, a massive zoo within The Olympic Park. However, what makes the Biodome unique is how each of the 5 exhibits had replicated the original environment they are based on. So for the tropical rainforest, you walk into a sealed dome where the temperate and humidity are artificially pumped up to match the real rainforest. This means the animal enclosures aren't sealed away, and you can see birds flying above your head and animals up close.

For yet another biking adventure, I peddled for 40 minutes all the way to the Old Harbor. It's much livelier around 7pm, the shops and food trucks are actually open, and crowds of people wander the many nice pathways along the water. It's where I'm writing todays blog rn.

## Day 4 - F1 Festivals
On the Thursday before the official start of the F1 weekend, is also the start of many F1 festivals throughout the city. Usually starting around noon and into the night, I encountered at least 3 separate events on my morning walk to Old Montreal.

Since I had some time to kill before the fun really kicks in, I used my MTL Passport to ride the Bateau-Mouche cruise. This was a 90 minute tour around the St. Lawrence Canal, where I got to see many interesting landmarks around the coast and islands. I even got to eat my lunch poutine on the boat!

Now the busier afternoon, I go revisit the mural festival to see a livelier street filled with more people and actual murals this time. Lots of shops and food on the street of other businesses makes for an enjoyable walk across Saint-Laurent Boulevard. Some artist were still making progress on their murals, so visit as late as possible or just multiple times to see the art progress.

At the end of the pedestrianized street is Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, which was even busier than when I last visited. While there weren't any festivals on the street, the neighborhood itself was still as interesting as ever to explore. Had to watch out for cars on the intersection, and bikers pedaling alongside the pedestrians. Also it borders on insane with how many restaurants line the main street, it makes me wonder how any of them even stay in business.

Finally, I biked back to downtown early to grab dinner at Reuben's Deli & Steaks, fairly pricy for well... good deli and steaks.

There apparently is no place more synonymous that Montreal F1 than the festival on Crescent road. Even on the day before the racing, an entire 3 block radius was electrified with energy. Droves of people crossing through the worst traffic jam, pop up merch shops everywhere I went, and that's not even me at the main street yet. Know that this was around 6pm, well before the peaks of the festival, and it was still this chaotic.

I'm now also 90% certain that Montreal's entire festival industry is held up by gambling and energy drinks lol. I can guarantee that the majority of the ads and sponsors are one of the two.

## Day 5 - Race Day and Off to Quebec City
Today marks the start of the F1 weekend, and the day I decided to leave Montreal because my room would have been more expensive. Maybe I'll attend the race another year, but I never did party in the nightlife, plus I had no friends to join me. Even without a (ridiculously expensive) ticket, I decided to visit the Sainte-Helene island to see how close I can get to Notre-Dame island where the racetrack is.

STM transit paused the strike because of how important F1 was, so I got to ride the metro from the hostel and across the channel. There are some interesting quirks about the system, from the transfer system, to the fare zones, and the subway itself based on France's metro using rubber wheels. Anyone visiting out of Quebec needs to research the STM and these differences ahead of time. The Chronos app also let me skipped the long lines at the ticket booths, so try and have your OPUS card prefilled ahead of time.

Normally, Sainte-Helene is a large green space, with an amusement park, bike paths, and the Biosphere. Today I got swept up in the mobs of people shuffling their way through the maze of chained fencing and security to cross the bridge into Notre-Dame. Well I wasn't planning to watch legit anyways, so I tried walking around the edge of the island to see if I can watch from across the channel. There actually was a vantage point at the southern end of Sainte-Helene with a clear view of Notre-Dame, but deviously the race track is blocked by trees.

There was definitely no way to see anything but the briefest of flashing lights, so I kept walking along the Eastern coast before I encountered a lot of security. Funny thing was that they didn't really mind me being far from where actual visitors should be, and I ended up on a hour long quest to get back to the metro station. It took a lot of asking around and wandering behind locked off areas, but I eventually made it back to the central plaza and back to the metro.

any img I may have here?

Oh, and I may or may not had discovered some unguarded point where I could have jumped onto and across the bridge~. If I wasn't carrying around my luggage and had a bus to catch that afternoon, who knows? Maybe I would have videos of sleek cars going really fast.

I'm now back to the main island and at the bus terminal at 11am. With 5 hours to kill, I visited the national library just across the street. A massive and modern 5 story library spanning multiple sections, with a comfortable interior and a great place to brush off my writing. Just don't look out onto the main street.

With one ticket left on my MTL Passport, I visit Le Saint-Bock Brasseria Artisanale just next door. TODO some poutine and beer
