My next leg of the journey takes me through Quebec, the French speaking province of Canada. While Ottawa had bilingual signs and services in both English and French, the Quebec cities of Montreal and Quebec City has everything primarily in French. Thanks to the long history of the province spanning centuries well before the Canadian Dominion, there is an incredibly unique culture that's a refreshing change from the rest of English Canada.....

Also I'm aware about not using the accented letters for French words. ... Anyways>

# Montreal

# Day 0 - New Orleans
Simply an excellent ride from Ottawa to Montreal. While slightly more expensive than Flixbus, New Orleans buses have comfier seats, nicer interiors, more legroom (enough for a footrest), and wasn't booked full so I didn't need to squeeze next to someone else. Plus, I manage to find the coupon code: ECONO50, for a casual 50% off my tickets lol. It doesn't give me their reward points when applied, but I wasn't planning to bus frequently anyways. Only complaint was the slow and inconsistent wifi, couldn't' watch Youtube like with Flixbus, but it is what it is.

Arriving in Montreal's bus terminal was the biggest cultural shock I've experienced on this trip. In my mind, I kinda just brushed past the french speaking province fact, so walking along a street with french advertisements, signposts, and people was cold water to the face. If anything, that feeling probably indicates you're traveling good by experiencing something unfamiliar to yourself. Montreal also has a large English speaking population, so it's a good city to start any trip in Quebec and get accustomed to the language. I had about a week to learn French, and I'm too embarrassed to try speaking any of it in public.

Traffic was bad in Montreal's downtown, but still better than Toronto. There were long lines of cars in the lane and parked on the street, and aggressive drivers trying to get ahead of the lights. Pedestrian's and bikers where even bolder, where at least 75% of the people there are jumping red lights, edging the traffic before it's clear, and even racing past other cars every chance they get. All this made for a chaotic city environment, which I imagine is what New York on a smaller scale feels like. You'll see with future pictures.

It was a slow walk until I reached the Saintlo hostel in Montreal, a bigger and more modern building with an interior like a motel. It was a great visit though, and for a reasonable price I got to stay in the downtown area and near some major bike paths. Good location is honestly a subtle but important benefit of hostels, as often they are always in or near the popular areas and near transit for most travelers who are probably not driving. This Saintlo location is definitely also nicer and busier than the Ottawa location, with free guided tours, nice lobby and kitchen area, and a cleaner feel to the whole building.

STM, the montreal transit agency, just so happened to start striking the entire week I was visiting, so all my plans revolving around the comprehensive metro system was thrown out the window. Thankfully, Montreal is also known for their comprehensive biking network, and with their BIXI monthly pass only costing $23 dollars, I actually saved some money and got a good workout that didn't strain my leg. The day I landed was the last day of a Japanese themed festival near the canal, and so the perfect opportunity came to try city biking.

I have mixed feelings, which I'll cover in the next section, but my first time biking on a street with cars racing past me was definitely not a good start. Turns out many streets don't have bike paths, so me starting without planning my route caused me a long detour as I was too scared to ride on normal streets.

The festival itself was fine. It was fascinating to see the Japanese culture and weebs in a French setting, which I thought was more normal and less bizarre English weeb culture. The traditional performances were great, the atmosphere was bustling, the crowds overwhelming. Food lines were about 20 minutes, and it took me awhile to realize I could have just paid at the booth and start lining up immediately, and not paying online then getting lost for too long.

# Day 1 - Central Montreal
After developing a fear of biking into an average Montreal street, I decided to start easy and take a straight, express route (REV route) to Old Montreal. They are marked in blue and are intended as big boy bike lanes to push lots of people through them. Conveniently there happens to be one behind my hostel, just under the train bridge and pass the 4 lane into giant fucking highway entrance. I end up walking my bike to the starting point.

When I arrived to Old Montreal, the Basilique Notre-Dame had just open for visiting. Many of the major attractions offer student discount just by showing id, so I got to visit for just $14. Another fact, the Basilique is giant (but not the biggest in Montreal), with such intricate interior that I'm only to demonstrate with my high-res images.

![High-res close up of the central shrine](./20250609_094301.avif)

I'm going to skip most of todays pictures as I came back on a better day with more activity. Visiting on a monday with rainstorms really hampers the good vibes. Take these pictures as Montreal's slowest days.

The Basilique sits in the center of Old Montreal, which was barren at 10am on a monday. Honestly, only a couple of streets were worth checking out, as most places just felt empty or even abandoned. It occasionally borders depressing, knowing that the historic architecture is just that, historic and bulldozed everywhere else. The nice street thought, were lined with shops and checkered flag, the cosy section to hang around.

![Old Montreal slow day](./20250609_104322.avif)

Nearby is the old harbor, a nice walking and biking area with famous landmarks like the Grande ferris wheel, zip line, and circus de chalae TODO. The costal breeze and bustling activities makes this a popular place to check out.

If the Japanese festival (and a future Korean festival), didn't already indicate, there is a sizable asian population in Montreal. Just past the 8 lane highway going through the city center, is a little Chinatown of about 10 blocks. Getting off the congested main street and onto the smaller side paths are lines of chinese/asian shops. Sammi Soup Dumplings is a small chain of xiaolongbao restaurants, and a yummy one too.

![Side street in Chinatown](./20250609_111530.avif)

This was when the hour long rainstorm hit, and I waited out the rain in a boba shop. Afterwords I made my way to St. Lawrence to check out an ongoing mural festival. It was nice that the area was closed off to cars, so we can walk wherever on the street, which I do appreciate with Montreal's festivals. Any event like this will usually reroute cars away so people can just walk around without worrying about traffic. This also gives space for more patio seating and small booths for shops and exhibits. Once again though, monday and raining meant today was real empty, so I'll come back to this place later.

![Family of ducks at nearby park](./20250609_152954.avif)

I've always been a Canadian, so I've already had poutine in my hometown. From Costco slop and overpriced bar scran, my previous favorite poutine came out of a shipping container in Radium, BC. I use to think poutine as heavy though, something that makes me sick of it the more I eat. BUT! The poutine at La Banquise was just c'est excellent! Like holy, I can't think of another dish where after eating til I was sick full that I wanted to order even more! Gravy was deliciously savory with a hint of sweetness, and the cheese curds melted in my mouth with delight. With a restaurant with such prestige, I had to order a deluxe poutine. Mine came with smoked meat, bacon, sausages, and pepperoni, all of it prepared excellently.

![La Banquise poutine](./20250609_165348.avif)

La Banquise is such a easy recommendation to give. Great food, reasonable price, and next to the popular Le Plateau-Mont-Royal. If you plan to try it yourself just be prepared for long lines. For reference, today was a monday and raining, and yet the place was almost full. Busy days could hae you waiting hours for a spot.

Man biking in Montreal is such a bipolar experience. My ride from La Banquise back to the hostel happens to be along a protected bike lane, and it was just plain fun. Never seen another North American city with bike traffic so long and intense as here. The feeling of straight, uninterrupted routes is like no other. Didn't even feel my leg injury, as the Achilles tendonitis only affected the lower leg/ankle, and not the hamstring/calf actually used in biking. 

TODO any img of biking

But there always have to be caveats. [The latter half of this video from Not Just Bikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yDtLv-7xZ4) summarizes my feelings as well (the metro/buses were on strike so I didn't ride them), that being

1. The moment you deviate from the designated bike route, you're often thrown onto a car filled street and have to fend for yourself. As expansive of Montreal's bike network is, a closer look reveals tons of stranded blocks and disjoint networks stitched together in a confusing manner. Multiple construction projects covering the bike lane either diverts to a makeshift bike/pedestrian lane, or just has us going down the street with the cars. 
2. Downtown is chaotic for both bikers and drivers. I saw people jumping the red lights, bikers edging incoming cars to cross faster, and cars inching towards columns of people on turns trying to cut through the crowds. It's a disaster waiting to happen, and I wish I bought a helmet in case I became said disaster.

## Day 2 - 
My hostel offered a walking tour of the nearby Canal and Atwater Market, but in the afternoon. With nothing else to do, I pretended to be a white collar worker and followed the flow of the commuters. I got to see a couple more landmark in downtown, churches, this giant ring, and an entire underground city connecting multiple metro stations. Not thinking about how big the ring really was, this underground city was a series of long hallways lined with restaurants, and clearly meant for business folks as most places were closed preparing box lunches for the lunch rush.

Later during the tour, I got to hang around with some fellow travelers from the US and England, and took a stroll down to the Atwater Market. About the size of a medium warehouse, the interior is one long hallway lined with stores selling all sorts of groceries and produce. The food court is on the end, and offered pastries, deserts, sandwiches, salads, and pastas. The grilled cheese was fairly solid for what I got, and this strawberry sweet was delicious.

Honestly, my next decision to visit Mount-Royal came on a whim, otherwise I would have prepared another water bottle. This is a massive hill in the center of Montreal, with about 100 meters of incline just to climb from downtown to the base. A tough but rewarding biking trail, with beautiful park areas, natural trails, and a iconic view of the city from the Charlet de Mount-Royal.

![Artificial pond/ice rink within the park](./20250610_174637.avif)

Because I came on a whim, I also hadn't finalized my hiking route and I ended up circling around the entire area. It all worked out anyways, as I wandered to the nearby Oratorie St-Joseph. If you thought the previous Notre-Dame was grand, St-Joseph is the biggest cathedral in Canada, and ?#? in the world. These images fail to capture the sheer scale of this structure, but needless to say, just looking out from the base was intimidating enough. They offer free entry and run on donations, and I got sit through a latin ceremony (still don't know what it was about, but the lute and singing was holy), and a museum.

With me now wandered so far away, I sorta gave up supressing my hunger and jumped this nearby France bistro. They were very French authentic, as in $40 for high-class chicken type eatery.

Walking at night is actually quite nice, with good lighting and still a bustling population that gave off good vibes.

## Day 3 - Little Italy and Botanical Garden
For my third day, I wanted to hit the far away attractions of Little Italy in the west, and the Botanical Garden in the north. Now with my left calf starting to cramp, and since the metro is still on strike, I make use of my monthly Bixi pass to bike 2+ hours all across Montreal. I'd clearly never experienced real city biking until now, because the commitment, thrill, and human spirit it takes to travel 30+ km by shear muscle power is insurmountable to the average car driver, nevertheless the daily commute by bike gigachads.

Starting with a brisk 44 minute ride to Little Italy, I arrive around 10am to a quiet neighborhood, with places other than the Jean Talon Market still preparing to open shop. Speaking of the market, Jean Talon is a semi-open venue filled with produce, flowers, and food stands. It's a lovely place to get lost among the shops, especially so early when the crowds are still small.

On the way out, I stumble and bonded together with some fellow travelers trying some local oysters. There are probably three main dishes to try in Quebec: poutine, duck, and oysters, and this oyster stand selling every variety of canadian oysters for ~$2.50 each is an incredible bargain for such a great snack! I didn't even know oysters could have such different flavours depending on the location, from salty to creamy and everything else in between.

img of oysters

Montreal's Little Italy was by far the nicest out of Toronto's and Ottawa's. In both size, beauty, and variety of shops. There are quite a lot of extra luxurious dinning spots, but some hidden gems around the market and off the main streets. Only real complaint was the main road cutting through the neighborhood gets really busy and annoyingly loud, so sitting on a street patio became somewhat uncomfortable. At least I got some good Ravioli.

img of Ravioli

Next up was the Botanical Garden, about 30 minutes away by bike. There are many themed sub sections within the area, each with a unique setting of greenery to check out. Pictures can't exhibit the beauty and serenity of actually being present among the nature, only visiting in person will do the place justice, but I'll post my images anyways

Right across the garden is the Biodome, a massive zoo within The Olympic Park. However, what makes the Biodome unique is how each of the 5 exhibits had replicated the original environment they are based on. So for the tropical rainforest, you walk into a sealed dome where the temperate and humidity are artificially pumped up to match the real rainforest. This means the animal enclosures aren't sealed away, and you can see birds flying above your head and animals up close.

For yet another biking adventure, I peddled for 40 minutes all the way to the Old Harbor. It's much livelier around 7pm, the shops and food trucks are actually open, and crowds of people wander the many nice pathways along the water. It's where I'm writing todays blog rn.

## Day 4 - F1 Festivals
On the Thursday before the official start of the F1 weekend, is also the start of many F1 festivals throughout the city. Usually starting around noon and into the night, I encountered at least 3 separate events on my morning walk to Old Montreal.

img of fest being set up

Since I had some time to kill before the fun really kicks in, I used my MTL Passport to ride the Bateau-Mouche cruise. This was a 90 minute tour around the St. Lawrence Canal, where I got to see many interesting landmarks around the coast and islands. I even got to eat my lunch poutine on the boat!

img of boat

Now the busier afternoon, I go revisit the mural festival to see a livelier street filled with more people and actual murals this time. Lots of shops and food on the street of other businesses makes for an enjoyable walk across Saint-Laurent Boulevard. Some artist were still making progress on their murals, so visit as late as possible or just multiple times to see the art progress.

img of festival

At the end of the pedestrianized street is Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, which was even busier than when I last visited. While there weren't any festivals on the street, the neighborhood itself was still as interesting as ever to explore. Had to watch out for cars on the intersection, and bikers pedaling alongside the pedestrians. Also it borders on insane with how many restaurants line the main street, it makes me wonder how any of them even stay in business.

Finally, I biked back to downtown early to grab dinner at Reuben's Deli & Steaks, fairly pricy for well... good deli and steaks.

There apparently is no place more synonymous that Montreal F1 than the festival on Crescent road. Even on the day before the racing, an entire 3 block radius was electrified with energy. Droves of people crossing through the worst traffic jam, pop up merch shops everywhere I went, and that's not even me at the main street yet. Know that this was around 6pm, well before the peaks of the festival, and it was still this chaotic.

I'm now also 90% certain that Montreal's entire festival industry is held up by gambling and energy drinks lol. I can guarantee that the majority of the ads and sponsors are one of the two.

## Day 5 - Race Day and Off to Quebec City
Today marks the start of the F1 weekend, and the day I decided to leave Montreal because my room would have been more expensive. Maybe I'll attend the race another year, but I never did party in the nightlife, plus I had no friends to join me. Even without a (ridiculously expensive) ticket, I decided to visit the Sainte-Helene island to see how close I can get to Notre-Dame island where the racetrack is.

STM transit paused the strike because of how important F1 was, so I got to ride the metro from the hostel and across the channel. There are some interesting quirks about the system, from the transfer system, to the fare zones, and the subway itself based on France's metro using rubber wheels. Anyone visiting out of Quebec needs to research the STM and these differences ahead of time. The Chronos app also let me skipped the long lines at the ticket booths, so try and have your OPUS card prefilled ahead of time.

img of subway

Normally, Sainte-Helene is a large green space, with an amusement park, bike paths, and the Biosphere. Today I got swept up in the mobs of people shuffling their way through the maze of chained fencing and security to cross the bridge into Notre-Dame. Well I wasn't planning to watch legit anyways, so I tried walking around the edge of the island to see if I can watch from across the channel. There actually was a vantage point at the southern end of Sainte-Helene with a clear view of Notre-Dame, but deviously the race track is blocked by trees.

img of island trees

There was definitely no way to see anything but the briefest of flashing lights, so I kept walking along the Eastern coast before I encountered a lot of security. Funny thing was that they didn't really mind me being far from where actual visitors should be, and I ended up on a hour long quest to get back to the metro station. It took a lot of asking around and wandering behind locked off areas, but I eventually made it back to the central plaza and back to the metro.

any img I may have here?

Oh, and I may or may not had discovered some unguarded point where I could have jumped onto and across the bridge~. If I wasn't carrying around my luggage and had a bus to catch that afternoon, who knows? Maybe I would have videos of sleek cars going really fast.

I'm now back to the main island and at the bus terminal at 11am. With 5 hours to kill, I visited the national library just across the street. A massive and modern 5 story library spanning multiple sections, with a comfortable interior and a great place to brush off my writing. Just don't look out onto the main street.

img of library

With one ticket left on my MTL Passport, I visit Le Saint-Bock Brasseria Artisanale just next door. Cool staff, plus I got some above average poutine and great beers!

And that's the end of Montreal, but not Quebec, as no visit is complete without also seeing Quebec City.
