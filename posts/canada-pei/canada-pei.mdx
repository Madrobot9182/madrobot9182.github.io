While my stay in Moncton was as bare-bones as it gets, my next four nights would take me to the charming little island of Prince Edward Island, PEI for short. Most people tend to forget about this province (alongside the northern provinces and maybe Newfoundland), but the small community is where I conversed with the most people in and outside the hostel. I really appreciate the close knit community of a small city/medium town, where people say good morning to each other on your walks, and identifying yourself by your city actually feels meaningful. At least that's what I like to imagine the locals here think about their island.

## Day 0 - Maritime Bus

Within the Atlantic provinces, the only real shuttle service is Maritime bus. Two things make then stand out over Flixbus and Orleans Express: they ship mail alongside passengers, and they rely on a hub and spock network. I imagine since the population of these provinces are sparse and far apart, Maritime bus couldn't rely on just driving between major cities for their business. In my case, both of my trips to PEI and Nova Scotia stopped in Amherst, as a transfer hub for busses running across borders. Jumping between smaller towns, the bus terminals were usually just parking lots next to VIA stations or even just a normal gas station like in Amherst.

The quality of the busses themselves swung between brand new interior, to dust flying out of the seat when I touch it. The older busses did the job don't get me wrong, I just miss the legroom and tray table from my previous trips. The drive itself went smoothly, with this wicked view of the big bridge to PEI.

Exiting the Charlottetown's bus station, I immediately realize that there is no sidewalk and I have to cross the street. A little foreshadowing for later. The walk itself was about 20 minutes, still dragging and carrying my broken suitcase, until I reached my hostel. A cosy house, refurbished into a compact living space. I stayed in the attic, where the slanted roof was the ceiling that I hit at least a dozen times during my stay.

With some time before sunset, I went to explore the walkway around the harbor. First thing I encountered was the Founder's food hall and market, an old brick warehouse now converted for multiple vendors and stalls. Spacious lawn with comfy chair and performers, and even a second floor with sodas and a bar. From all the good looking options for dinner, yeah there was no competition of course I had to try the sushi burrito. What a stupid, yet ingenious idea that actually tasted alright.

Getting back onto the walk I said I was doing two paragraphs ago, strolling through the quiet boardwalk surrounded by natural beauty and sounds felt like a stressful day melting away into tranquility. Watching the sparse crowd of tourist and locals hang about Confederation park, watching the bees fly among the colorful flowers, fishermen at the port staring off into the horizon, helped slow down my bustling city grindset into one where I no longer feared wasting time getting lost among the land. Charlottetown is a small place, but that didn't hinder my enjoyment of PEI one bit.

It also slipped my mind that the Cow's Ice Cream company is from PEI, seeing that they got locations in every town of PEI, but sparsely anywhere else in Canada. I had only been to the one in Banff, but I figured might as well try the ice cream in their home town. Of course it was damn good, but surprising not actually the best I had in PEI. Foreshadowing truly is the literacy device of all time.

## Day 1 - Charlottetown

I started my morning breakfast by meeting a kind fellow from Quebec who drove me to the Saturday's farmers market, and out of all the farmers markets I've been to, this one definitely felt the most "farmers". Every booth was a small business of 1-3 people selling all kinds of locally produced food, sauce, arts, and whatever else kinds of goods. This was also the busiest and most bustling place I'd been in, with droves of people and a massive parking lot completely filled. Good options for lunch as well, especially from the ethnic food stalls.

I really did like PEI, which is why I only have two real complaints. I'll address the second complaint in day 2, but my biggest gripe partially with Charlottetown is the absurd amount of cars in the city. For such a small and cozy town, I've seen less cars in bigger metropolises with exponentially more people. Almost every intersection had a car waiting on me, and lights took painfully long to change just so I could cross a two lane street. My biggest shock though was the street parking, which is done diagonally to fit as many cars as possible along every major street where people eat and shop. It's pretty easy to understand why though, every major government and private service is probably in Charlottetown's, so all the people living in remote communities need to drive in for their business. Local transit does exist, but from all the Walmart ass sized parking lots at every shopping center, it's clear that all the residents, where the suburbs are still a good half hour walk away from downtown, relies on driving to get around. How can I blame them when this was the walk I took to get back to downtown!

You can see this better in the Confederation mall which was virtually empty, but parking was completely occupied.

Nevertheless, I was gonna explore the entire town in one day on foot. The city itself has a couple of walking routes, which can cover the entire downtown core and Victoria park before sunset. I started out West to complete the boardwalk that spans all of Charlottetown's coast. Through the multiple neighborhoods I saw, there's a clear pattern of richer residents living further out from the center, and the small condos make way for giant lake houses.

The walk along the boardwalk towards Victoria park looked perfect. No clouds, good breeze, perfect view of the water, quite hot, sunscreen needed. You know that you're in a good place when you just wanna sit down and stay where you are just a bit longer.

Victoria park itself was also really nice, with open fields for playgrounds, pitches for many sports, and trails within dense forest that felt like I was back at a national park. It's a nice area to picnic/hang out in, limited people and very peaceful environment.

Cutting through the nearby government buildings and back towards the harbor, I then walked along the boardwalk going East towards the city. The scenery here changes from big park to apartment buildings and service roads, but still along the coast. At this point in time, students are graduating and cruise boats haven't started arriving yet, so many of the tourist buildings aren't open. Honestly though, I much prefer the quieter PEI over the rush hour, it's just a vibe walking alone next to the ocean.

Eventually the boardwalk ends abruptly, and I have to navigate around private properties to get back to the harbor. From the concrete port to the Founder's market is where most of the foot traffic and activities are. There's this dock area filled with food stalls and a floating patio with benches and swings. Kinda just feeling the vibes, I spent a hefty amount on a lobster roll, the big name dish in the Maritime. Honestly I found that to be so backwards, the island known for their plentiful seafood industry charging 50% more for seafood dishes, while being somehow cheaper in landlocked provinces where all seafood is imported.

## Day 2 - Cavendish

Today I planned to visit the Northern beaches and parks of Cavendish, an hour drive across the island. Here's is where I really appreciated PEI's and their T3Transit's commitment to improving public transit, because outside the $2 fares, they operate shuttle busses that run throughout all of PEI, but is part of the transit network. So for just $2, I could take the bus from downtown to Royalty Crossing mall, then transfer to a bus that'll take me across the entire island, all in one trip! They also use brand new Maritime busses, the big shuttle busses I rode to get from Moncton to Charlottetown, so seating is beyond comfortable to the point I wonder why they don't use these nice busses in the busier cross provincial routes. Wasn't complaining though, I got a nice sightseeing tour across the farmlands and remote communities.

For anyone who also wants to follow my path, you do have to book these remote busses ahead of time (even though they are virtually empty). Transfers are also done over the radio, so you need to let the bus driver know you want to transfer and they'll tell the other drivers your intentions. It's a very interesting system, and amusingly chaotic to sit right at the front and listen to the radio chatter.

Cavendish, a national park, is known for its beaches, dunes, and a small community of amusement parks and sites. My bus goes through multiple stops along the boardwalk before reaching the main beach, which I got off at the first stop. While I didn't go in myself, the Ripely's Believe it or Not museum showcases a whole bunch of fringe and strange exhibits and is one of four exhibits in this part of Cavendish. Just look at the giant transformer and driftwood statue at the front!

To get to the beach from here, I had to walk along the road, which the government clearly knew since they built a wooden sidewalk to the nearest parking lot and foothold of the national park. Right at the entrance of the main beach is a washroom and cafe, with access to the sands by a short boardwalk. This place is significant because of the sand dunes right behind the beach, and is protected for conservation. There is an endangered species of birds that nests in the area, and the tip of the coast is closed off. Physically, the dunes are a big ridge that separates the view of the waters from the parking lot, covered in special foliage not found anywhere else.

The trails themselves are very beginner friendly and great for biking. In fact, the two other nearby national parks are connected by one long costal trail, and takes the whole day by foot to cross. The main trail goes from the camping site to the end of the sand dunes, across a lake, and onto this vantage point. By jumping the short fence, I climbed along the rock cliffs and got a pleasant view of the coast and unique wildlife to PEI

Turning the other way, I enter the Cavendish campsite and cut through towards another trail that loops around the bay. I read some signs that described how the many of the pines trees were destroyed by a hurricane, and how new conservation efforts involve replacing the old forest with stronger, native trees. Hence why many areas along the trail are filled with logs and dead trees.

I did turn around early, as there were warning for coyotes in the area. Figured it wasn't worth the risk since I was solo and without any equipment. The forest further into the trail was still incredibly dense, so much so that I couldn't see into the treeline. You could film a horror movies in theses woods.

img of that trail

Oh. It did start raining at this point, that being when I decided to walk along the beach back to the cafe and washroom. The rocks here were dyed a signature shade of red, and many seashells were buried in the sand. Many shells were also cracked, and I wonder how many red stains was actually blood from unfortunate visitors. When the rain really start to intensify, I appreciated my foresight to bring a jacket, but not a pair of socks when I failed to jump over a stream and ended up walking barefoot along the shell laced sands.

After using my downtime before my bus to dry off as much as possible, I make it back to Royalty Crossing only to discover that the busses stop running at 5pm on Sundays. To save the hassle of learning this the hard way, there are no Uber's in Charlottetown. They apparently have their own ride-share service, but I ended up searching and calling a taxi back to the hostel. It costed $10.25 and only a minor amount of getting soaked while waiting.

## Day 3 - Summerside

Today I booked the same service for a shuttle to Summerside. It only operates on the Weekdays, with slightly more frequency. I will say though, it is a very cost effective way to sightsee rural PEI, especially now I was traveling down the busier highway.

img of along the way

Summerside itself is the second biggest city in PEI, but still a small town I could walk through in an hour. They have a boardwalk that stretches the entire length of their coast, a cozy little downtown, and a few seafood factories and markets at the ports.

I definitely took my time here, as I wasn't in a rush to explore everything. I really appreciated the lawnchairs spread along the boardwalk, making for a really nice view to relax too.

And finally, a special shout out is deserved to Holden's Ice Cream, which managed to be the best ice cream at the best price I've ever had! $11 for 4 scoops, all of which was hand made and delicious. Everything sold had taxes prepaided, and they even have a loyalty program just because why not at this point. Their backyard was also a gorgeous garden and the perfect place for 4 scoops of ice cream btw. Cow's Ice Cream would probably be half the scoops for close to the same price (with taxes). They even had my favorite soda, with special flavors not imported into my home province, and still somehow cheaper than back home!

I was in a real good mood after that (and really hungry), so I went to yet another famous seafood shop in Charlottetown. From what I heard of fellow visitors, The Water Prince Corner Shop probably serves the best seafood chowder, lobster rolls, and seafood dishes in the city. I testify to the chowder and my 1 lb lobster dinner, which was just an entire lobster cooked and served on the spot. Very pricy, probably the most expensive food one could get, but for a one time experience -- peak. I took an hour just to really enjoy myself.

## Day 4 - Off to Halifax

Having already explored most of the city and the food, I finally slowed down a bit and just spend the morning writing at the waterfront. As I've insisted many time already, PEI was a wonderful place to explore. A beautiful island that felt welcoming as a small and interconnected community. If I ever revisit again, I'd rent a SUV and roadtrip across the whole island. The weather is good for outdoor adventures, and plenty safe enough for me to consider it.
