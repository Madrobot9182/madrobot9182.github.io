Canada has a funny trend between the major provinces, where their biggest city isn't always their capital. Vancouver in British Columbia, Regina in Saskatchewan, Montreal in Quebec, respectively their provinces biggest cities, but not their provincial capitals. There's a lot thats special about Quebec City, from their history, architecture, demographic, and status as a UNESCO world heritage site. This city is strikingly different from Montreal, and a wholly different experience to boot.

# Quebec City

## Day 0 - New Orleans (2)

Same bus, similar experience. I guess it was interesting to see the roads from the perspective of a driver this time. Plus lots of construction getting out of Montreal. It was also cool seeing how the rural sections between the cities change over time.

After a stop in Sainte-Foy, I am dropped off at the Quebec City train and bus station. In theory, the walk from here to the hostel should be a brisk 10 minutes, but I got to discover first hand just how hilly the city is. Old Quebec is built on top of an entire mound, and I had to climb my way up from the water level just to reach my hostel.

Little history lesson that I learned through museums and tours, Quebec City was originally a French colony, and was in a great defensive position on the St. Lawrence. During the early struggles between the French and British in the American colonies, Quebec city would attempt to construct a fort, then turned citadel, under French, then British occupied rule during the 18th-19th century. What remains now is the only fortified city north of Mexico, with much of the old walls and cannons still preserved and on display. This preservation of the walls had also preserved the old town within, so Old Quebec still looks and feels like a European town. UNESCO would declare the entire old town a preservation site, and that's how we ended up with one of the prettiest and nicest areas in Canada to walk around.

My hostel was ran by HI hostels, a collection of hostels across Canada (mostly in the rockies and west coast). The area was even bigger than my Montreal stay, with multiple buildings worth of rooms and dorms connected like a proper hotel. Definitely felt busier, my room was way larger, and also there were a lot of kids. Like this may sound weird because I never brought it up, but I never really saw kids in my hostels due to age restriction and parental supervision, but there were a lot of families with kids, which is a common theme I'll mention later on.

Before the night closed, I went to sit on the wall. Yes it was open to the public and yes it was cool to see that you could just walk along the old walls and take in the sights. Also the fire alarm went off when I was trying to sleep.

## Day 1 - Old Quebec

I couldn't imagine any other start than just getting lost in Old Quebec. For what is a relatively small area that I would eventually memorize, there really is something special about just walking around a city built to be beautiful and preserved in time. The Europeans really knew what they were doing with their cities, because I've never experienced a town with so many people actually being there to enjoy the cityscape, and not for work.

Past the famous Fairmount Le Chateau Frontenac, a castle like behemoth, I stumbled onto a boardwalk that took me along the walls of the citadel, and ended up at the highest point of the city.

![View of the neighboring city from the top of the hill](./20250614_115901.avif)

The citadel itself is still an active military base, while also serving guided tours and a museum. I hadn't even planned to visit, but since I was already there I might as well take a tour. ....Add mroe later....

Afterwords, I started my descent down the hill and ended up in front of the provincial Parliament building. A beautiful building in of itself, with two things happening in front of it:

1. An LGBPTQ+ rally in the front lawn. It was pride month (June), when I was going. If I could understand French I would also share their chants.
2. A cyclist race. Imagine 100+ cyclist neck and neck as they speed around the fountains and around the turns of the main street. Very satisfying to the eyes.

Old Quebec is a great place for street performers. Being in a place where people actually wants to hang out really helps with drawing in crowds and donations naturally. From musicians, singers, street performers, and artists, I saw at least 2 performers every day making a living through their talents alone.

![Performer standing on top a wheel](./20250614_151952.avif)

The most European part of town is Rue Saint-Pierre, just multiple flight of stairs from the fairmount hotel. A narrow street packed with people and shops, activity for all the eye can see.

..TODO anything else?..

## Day 2 - Montmorency Falls

To wait out the morning rush hour, I wandered down the Saint-Jean-Baptiste neighborhood to see the rustic housing architecture. Being built on a incline really added on to the European style of dense, personal, human sized neighborhoods that felt really cosy. The power lines were definitely in need of repairs though.

![Power lines and construction, stop sign on intersection](./20250615_093222.avif)

From up on the hillside, I descend down a column of stairs to reach the university station. Column is not doing the height justice, I was climbing down a cliff about as tall as a large residential skyscraper. There is so much vertically going in and out of the old neighborhoods it became somewhat tiring. 

The greater Quebec area operates the RTC transit system, a network of busses that links all the nearby neighborhoods. The normal routes are pretty infrequent, up to an half hour or even 50 minutes apart. To compensate, the metro line are a series of express routes that runs along the major roads in 15 minute intervals. Metro 800 goes from Sainte-Foy all the way to Montmorency fall in around a hour, and a connivent option for a tourist like myself. One thing I noticed fast was how much more suburbanized the neighborhoods became the farther out we went. My original awe towards the dense European style mid-rises makes way to comically large parking lots and multi lane freeways cutting through residential homes.

Montmorency falls itself is a paid park area, with green spaces to hike, picnic, and witness a waterfall technically taller than Nigeria falls. From on top the mountain with the suspending bridge and zipline, there is a massive set of stairs that took me to the bottom with a community center, gondola, and these views of the waterfall. There was even this viewing area so close to the falls that it felt like I'm standing in a thunderstorm. One way to refresh myself from all the stairs, which really is super tall.

The nearest bus stop back to Quebec is a fairly long walk, and I stumbled upon this "snack shack" along the way. Pretty pricey, but who knew how good the food in a small shack in a parking lot could be.

I decided to ride the bus further into downtown and visit the plains of Abraham. This was the original site where the British conquered the city of Quebec from the French, and remains as a public park. It's a fairly large area, with a loop for cycling, green spaces for picnics, and enough open land for kids to fly their kites. I saw a couple of performers, the Abraham museum, and even the venue for a future concert.

## Day 3 - Jacques-Cartier National Park

As the title says, I wanted to dedicate a day to exploring the rural areas outside the city, and settled on a day trip to the nearby National Park. A round trip with Quatre Natures costed me $55 for the bus and park pass, and went from 9 am to 4:30 pm. The trip itself went great, with lots of nice trails along the river and canyon of Jacques-Cartier. While I didn't have enough time to reach the famous Les Lopus trail, the shorter paths were also nice. I meet some really nice locals that day, including a class trip of elementary school kids all shouting Bonjour to me.

The shuttle driver even offered to take us to a boat rental, where I had a nice hour on a standup board. No pictures with me in the water, that's how I destroyed my old phone. I do promise I looked cool while boarding.

This wasn't originally suppose to be my only nature outing, I had plans to visit the island of Orleans, the Sanctuary of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, and the lands of Charlevoix. Except for maybe a short cruise to the Sanctuary, you really need a car to explore outside the city. 

After that exhausting day, splurged a lot more than I expected on some fine pasta and sweet creme brulee.

## Day 4 - Downtown and Coast

I started today by just walking West of Old Quebec, and walking among the locals. Lots of strolling through neighborhoods, some grocery shopping, and getting sun burnt from being outside all morning. One thing I noticed was all the medium density, mix use apartments as opposed to suburban standalone homes. Even coming from the other major cities, Quebec's residential areas feels the nicest to explore, on top of all the other benefits like more affordable homes etc.

And more poutine because why wouldn't I get more poutine here.

Which speaking of... There were a lot of kids in Quebec City specifically. Like this probably sounds weird to say out loud, but everyday here, I saw many youths with and without parents, from a circle of friends, to entire field trips and sports team. It was like every school from Montreal/Toronto was having a graduation trip the week I was there.

Anyway, I wasn't here to watch kids in Quebec City, so I went back to Rue Saint-Pierre and cut through to the harbor. I happen to stumble upon this TV show, where piano performers were playing in public to a crowd of people and three judges. For such a small venue, I gained a new sense of admiration for how much setup and logistics was on set. At least four camera hooked up to a broadcasting trailer and popup stand.

The edge of the harbor itself was closed off for some reason, so I could walk sorta near the waterfront. What I did stumble upon was this incredible open patio and bar that's submerged in water! You can put your feet in the water, and after so much walking this felt incredibly relaxing.

![Overview of the patio, with dry land and mini pools](./20250617_150115.avif)
![Me in the pool, writing my blog](./20250617_150419.avif)

Like with any harbor front, the water breeze always makes these area comfortable places to be during the hot summer days. Although today was raining slightly, I still found the weather to be perfect. It was easy going getting back to the Old City and ending the day with a burger and a evening stroll back to the hostel.

## Day 5 -  Off to Moncton

In my next blog, you'll get to read all about my experience with my VIA rail trip to Moncton in New Brunswick. However, since the train was due at 10 pm, I checked in my luggage and spent a nice slow day around Old Quebec. 

Something that's really underrated in Quebec is the amount of preserved architecture and important monuments and how they are so well integrated into the city. Anywhere I walked, I'd eventually stumble upon some historically significant exhibit, church, or important building. The estate of Samual de Champlain is just casually resting under the board walk beside the Fairmount hotel. The ruins of some houses were just left on display, and not to mention most of the walls surrounding the old town.

![Interior of the church in the center of Quebec](./20250618_145545.avif)

But what I appreciated most was just how nice it was to be present in Old Quebec. Much of the town felt welcoming and nice to be in, sitting on a bench and watching everyone go about their day. Even where traffic was the busiest, it was still limited to a single lane of cars and tour busses. Hence, where most busy cities may only have a few pockets of nice areas between their oceans of noise, most places here were nice to be in.

So all in all, I think Quebec City might be my favorite place between the locations I've already visited in Ontario and Quebec. The people were incredibly nice, atmosphere felt relatively calm, and maybe by 2040 Canada will finally build the high speed rail between the four cities I just bused through. Realistically though, if I were to be looking for work, I would see myself enjoying Montreal more than Toronto as a major metropolitan to work in.
