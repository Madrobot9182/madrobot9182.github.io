## Preface: So I may have lied about not blogging my personal life
But a 28 night journey around Eastern and Atlantic Canada was just calling for itself to be documented. Hence, what follow this and the next subsequent blog posts is my tech-turned-travel blog about how I decided not to spend the month of June rotting indoors, and finally finish my bucket list of traveling coast to coast. Special thanks to my parents for funding this unemployed student, couldn't have done this without you!

# Toronto
After almost being uncharged $50 because the wheels of my suitcase were a centimeter outside the carry-on constraint, I'm off the ground and heading to Pearson Airport. Fairly standard budget airline flight, aka I can't lean back without my knees hitting the seat.

My family had previously visited Toronto a couple years back, where we rented a car to drive around the city. Anyone who's had the misfortune to drive there will also know about the horrid traffic and parking adventures; Tourist who truly want to experience living like a local shall go get stuck on the 403 under construction for two hours.

This time however, I wanted to travel only by public transit, shuttles, and trains. My first four major cities, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, all use cards for tapping on and off transit. After landing in Pearson Airport, I went to the UP train station in terminal 1 to purchase a Presto Card, the system used in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and Ottawa. Those landing in terminal 3 also have a link train which connects directly with the station.

It sucks that this one train is triple the price of a bus though, taking the airport bus to the metro would only cost one fare. Still, I landed at 20:00, and wanted the speed and convince of getting to Union station since there was a underground night market just south of where the UP train stopped. The view on the way was also very nice~

Since I'm traveling solo and didn't have a car to sleep in, I opted for staying in hostels --  basically shared rooms with 6-10 people. There are many perks to hostels over hotels or Airbnb; Outside of lower cost, hostels are catered to backpackers (like me) and usually provide things like breakfast, a kitchen, bed sheets, and showers (sometimes with towels, you should probably bring your own supplies just in case). They are also usually located near a transit hot-spot, or in a popular location like downtown. Depending on your personality, staying with like-minded travelers is also a nice way to socialize, share stories, and make potential acquaintances. On the flip side, since everyone is sleeping together, the biggest concern to worry about is thieves. While every location I'm staying at has electronic locks and free lockers, you still need to watch over your stuff just in case. I keep my suitcase with clothes in luggage storage, while my backpack stays next to me at all times.

My first hostel is The Only Backpackers Inn, which as the names implies is the only hostel in Toronto. This is probably due to the fact that the government banned local GTA residences from staying in hotels and hostels. Still, .....

## Day 1 - "West" Downtown
To kick off my little escapade, I planned to start downtown if metro line 2 wasn't closed off. Like please TTC, explain how and why our 10 cart subway had to be stuffed onto 5 busses which take 10 times as long because every road is completely congested (on a Sunday by the way)?

So right off the bat, I'm already discarding my original route and improvising from the university campus. Not complaining though, it's a very large area covering much of Toronto downtown, with many gothic style buildings dating back to the 19th century. The summer (and especially on a Sunday) meant campus was virtually empty and a very peaceful place to walk around. Would have loved to sneak into the buildings though~

From campus, I strolled past the legislative building and crossed some neighborhoods to reach Chinatown, full of interesting businesses and peak food if it wasn't a Sunday morning and everything was closed. For future reference, 11am weekend is probably the time to visit. At least I got some food on my way out.

![Juicy dumpling](./20250601_110024.avif)

Walking west out of Dragon Mall is Kensington, known for their dense markets of small stores and restaurants. While I believe Chinatown is still the better value for food, there's still a lot to see and check out. I just followed the crowd and grab whats seems popular.

![Alleyway with lots of graffiti](./20250601_112803.avif)
![Flee market in an alley](./20250601_114059.avif)

Kensington is between Queens St for all the shops alongside it, and College St to connect to Little Italy and Korea Town. With no goal in mind, I end up wandering through whatever neighborhood looks interesting and let myself get lost among the dense residential areas. Much of the housing outside Toronto core are small, compact blocks that remained unchanged for the decades since they were first built. In fact, just a short walk around outer Toronto really shows the history and how long the city has existed

Among the constantly congested roads everywhere I went, to the busy urban shops along yet another congested road, I get to wonder how the locals resist throwing themselves off Gardiner Express from all the damn congestion. Like seriously, just compare the streetcars of Toronto to any European tram, and see how absurd it is that the streetcars are on the road with the cars? So they have to also wait at red lights and get stuck with all the cars? And that the streetcar just stops on the left lane and passengers exit onto the street? I live by the common saying of strong towns that the only solution to traffic is viable alternates to driving, and being able to out-walk 3 streetcars because they are stuck in the same traffic jam with the cars definitely doesn't count. Also street parking fucking everywhere only makes the city uglier and harder to navigate for everyone. 

road rage img grrr

All my walking is naturally tiring, especially carrying my backpack with supplies I bought from local grocery stores. There are plenty of smaller parks with benches throughout the neighborhoods, all serving great places to take breaks and enjoy the quiet. Eventually I end up in Trinity Bellwood park, a spacious green area full of picnics and sports. Can't help but sit down and relax with people watching.

Also this section is called the dog bowl, a pretty clever way to make a no leash dog park huh.

Connected to Queens, I finally get back to where I originally wanted to explore, until I stumble upon Ossington. A bustling street full of local bars/restaurants/small shops. There also seemed to be some advertising campaign on car barriers to promote the area, which really made me wonder why they couldn't make the road a pedestrian area. There are too many roads around this area anyways, banning the cars that are racing past the people cramped onto the sidewalks would exponentially help boost attraction to potential customers -- aka the pedestrians. Otherwise there were plenty of good choice for eating out, just like Kensington.

Going back to Little Italy, there is an italian joint called Sugo, a crazy busy joint unlike the surround area... I got lucky and they had a single spot on the barstools, otherwise the line could be up to an hour without reservation. Little bit pricy, but any creamy pesto sauce is worth it in my opinion.

Continuing to wander west, up to Dufferin and back towards Queens, lets just say the foot traffic get quieter and quieter. Loud roads, more homeless, less to see and more to walk faster away from. The encampment at Dufferin park however, surprised me with how clean the tents were. In my city struggling with a drug crisis, the "encampment" areas are always covered in spilt trash and reeks of that signature filth. With the cost of living in Toronto as is, I wonder how many of those homeless just couldn't afford rent and moved into the park. Not to say that Toronto doesn't struggle as much with homelessness, addiction, or liter, because they still do.

img of uhhh??

Even as Queens became less and less... desirable to walk down, I reached the end and crossed the walkway to the shores. 

img of walkway

It's a nice jogging and cycling trail along the coast; I got on a nearby bike share and took myself all the way back to downtown.

Also someone recognized my framework laptop! Just wanted to write that down to remember lol.

## Day 2 - Central Island
Funny thing about waking up early (8am) is that most places open around 10am. So after realizing the brunch place I was waiting on also didn't open on monday, I headed downtown to pickup some picnic subs. My ham sub costed about as much as a Subway, but at least didn't taste stale.

img of sub place

Get distracted, wander past a union strike, end up in front of the CN tower -- as people normally do. I've already went up the tower with my family, but still worth checking out alongside Ripely aquarium for first time visitors.

Crossing a three street/9 lane intersection towards the waterfront, the paths and green-spaces along the coast are just really nice spaces to be in. Costal breeze keeps the area cool, and there's plenty of open spaces and natural shade to get comfortable. Unfortunately, The noise pollution from the nearby roads and the airport on the neighboring island is really annoying.

Speaking of islands, there are numerous "water taxis", all competing to shuttle you to central island, and definitely not telling you about the official, cheaper Toronto water ferry. For reference, the ferry charged me $9.11 round trip, while the taxi on the neighboring port was asking $14 one way (they let everyone on the ferry back to the mainland). During the busier summertime, lines for the ferry get really long, and taxis become a faster alternative to waiting. [This website explains everything I needed to know.](https://www.torontoisland.com/ferry.php)

img of the ferry and taxi

I so happen to catch the ferry for east Ward point, but there is also routes for west Hanlan's point, and the popular middle island with most of the attractions. There are bike shares around the centre with excellent routes, but I ended up walking across the entire island in a casual 4 hours.

img of the map

Ward's point houses much of the residential zones, with quiet pathways and a lovely boardwalk along the south shores.

img ward

Centre island is much busier, with a pristine garden plaza, amusement park, restaurants, and a floating dock.

img centre, maybe comment between all the images

Hanlan's point is considerably more remote and less busy, with some nice natural areas and a historical lighthouse.

img lighthouse

Hanlan's point is also a significant place to the 2SLGBTQ+ community, being the site for Canada's first Gay Pride celebration and remains as a century old queer space. Hanlan's point also has a nudist beach, which I spent 20 minutes lost in because the next exit was really far. I recommend walking on the sand path behind the beach to not block the nudist sun-tanners, and enter through the northern entrances.

just put img it here

One long walk down the pride path later is the ferry terminal. There were also busses, I assume for people who don't want to wait at longer lines in centre terminal.

img of ferry back

Have to reiterate this again, but the walk along the coast is really nice. I ended up strolling all the way back to where I ended yesterdays bike ride. Nearby was the museum garden, nice natural steps to chill on, and a great spot to accidentally watch a children shows.

## Day 3 - Central Downtown and Bluejay Games
The St. Lawrence market near King/Union station has become the defacto farmers market, with tons of booths selling all sorts of food stuff. The south building has been around since Old Toronto was called York, and is open 6 days excluding monday. The north building recently finish construction, but only opens Saturday, and built so minimalistic to where everything feels sterile and small? South building was my priority.

idk images

There are tons of blogs and reviews about the "famous" Peameal Bacon sandwich, so I had to try it myself. Contrary to those reviews, it seems the price gone up to where it's honestly not worth the alright sandwich.

There are a lot of local sellers within the main floor and basements, selling everything from vegetables, meats, cheeses, seafood, and various ethic grocers. 

img of booths and smootie

A short walks away is the Distillery district, a former center for alcohol production turned pedestrianized tourist spot. Definitely more a nightlife centre as most places weren't open when I arrived, but the view was still worth the visit.

img of bricky

I then decided to try biking back and visit the cathedral church of St. James. The Tangerine app does show bike routes and docking stations. However, I got kinda lost, the nearest dock was full, and I wound up going in circles. There were some protected bike lanes, but along the main road the bike lane became an elevated sidewalk next to the cars and pedestrians. As long as you follow the marked pathway you'll be fine, some turn lanes are marked, otherwise you can dismount and walk alongside the pedestrians.

Queen's St East really felt like the slums of inner Toronto. Businesses literally falling apart and surrounded by the homeless, it's clear that foot traffic tethered off when the skyscrapers stop and old buildings begin. Like with many cities, post-covid saw a spike in homelessness, the effects of which are more visible then ever.

img of hobo

From the church to the Eaton centre, I'm back to skyscrapers, busy streets, and tons of constructions. Old Toronto has lots of classical architecture wedged between glass towers, being both charming but sometimes feeling out of place. The street along Eaton centre similarly got plenty of historical buildings like the theater next to the newly renovated shopping complex.

img of eaton street and eaton center

No visit to Toronto is complete without visiting the old city hall and Nathan Phillips square, a popular area for photographing.

Then comes my Chinatown runback for Sunday. Approaching from Dundas west, there were plenty of small shops and a few mini-malls with interesting food courts and local businesses. Chinatown runs primary along Spadina Avenue, with tons of asian businesses and dense foot traffic. The streetcar here also has a dedicated lane and platforms, one of the few in Toronto core.

And of course I had to see the Bluejay's play in their Roger's stadium! Following the crowd and traffic officers to reach the plaza near the CN tower, there are multiple entry gates with lines and security booths. The box office was permanently closed, and you have to buy online with the TicketMaster app. Gates open an hour early (hour half on weekends), but theres really only a line as game time draws closer. Bag checks are also really lenient, I got in with my school bag full of supplies and tomorrows breakfast.

Once inside the stadium, there are security at every seating entrance, and a couple of special locations for standing. The $20 general admission doesn't give seats, so I had to find a spot in the open sections to stand and watch. This view was from the fifth level TD Park Social.

img of td view

The game itself started with a bang. Two home runs, great bats, six runs! For the other team...

img of funny score

Baseball is a really slow sport to watch. Not helping was the fact that no plays happened for next 6 innings, the energy in the stadium was really sluggish. Any chants/cheers had to be prompted by the giant screen and loud music, as otherwise it's 15 seconds of silence between pitches. Coming from a city of NHL hockey, it's comically hilarious to see the displays telling the crowd to GET HYPED AT TWO STRIKES!!! GET LOUD!!! Like it's both begging the crowd to get excited, and that a batter at two strikes is the pinnacle of exciting baseball gameplay lmao. At least watching fans scramble to catch the foul balls was amusing.

Metro line 2 broke down on the way back ;(. Someone jumped onto the track and caused a power outage, and of course it had to be Sherbourne station, just before the bridge crossing. With no streetcars or busses, here I am writing the rest of today's blog. It was a long night.

img me stuck on subway

As an aside, the metro hasn't had a single day without some issues and delays. Surprise construction, security incidents on platforms, or just bizarre incidents like tonight. For such a big city, it's clear that transit has been neglected for decades, with how politicized it has become among Toronto city council and the province of Ontario. It's an interesting rabbit hole worth looking into.

## Day 4 - Leslieville & The Beaches
For the final day of Toronto, I wanted to explore the area east of the Don Valley Parkway. Leslieville, along Dundas and Queens St. east was frankly pitiful, so much so that I forgot to take any pictures. They are supposedly known for brunches and some landmarks, but just felt like a watered down version of Queens west. Didn't help that today was a hot 25 degrees, and I ended up on Eastern Avenue with noting but loud trucks and business parks. 

The best way to Cheery beach is through the distillery district, saving the extra hour it would have taken me to walk through Leslie street, with nothing but industrial trucks.

img of that one street

Along the way I discover Tatsuros, a Japanese hybrid brunch place. When I arrived around 12pm, they had ran out of their in house ice tea and cream bulle toast. The toast I received was alright, but the dull cream overwhelmed the blueberry jam, ruining what was a solid french toast.

img of toast

After wandering through another park, I finally reach The Beaches. This is a long stretch of sand beaches, with a half hour long boardwalk and bike path. Lots of space to tan, and a whole array of volleyball nets. The costal winds really turns a hot day into a pleasant walk, and I found myself pretty comfortable strolling in the 25 degree weather. 

img of beach

What a nice walk! ended up hanging around to write todays blog.

img of rocks and computer at benches

The end of The Beaches so happens to be where the Queens streetcar starts. This is a pretty affordable way to see Toronto core, as Queens runs through multiple popular destinations in its hour or so route. With a two hour transfer, I also planned to revisit Chinatown for a certain location, and so I hop on for the long ride ahead.

img of queens station

Traffic, construction, and even more traffic, the further we traveled downtown, the more agonizing the stops became. It's actually becomes faster to bike as the few bike lanes within the core are the only remaining lanes not congested.

img todo

And after getting some braised beef noodles in Chinatown, I went to checkout a Japanese arcade called Yume. For fans of Japanese rhythm arcades and games, there are various imported machines from manufactures like Sony, Bandi Namco, Konami, all modified to work with Yume's membership cards. There's also a couple of Mahjong tables for open play. For about $10 an hour, I could see myself getting hooked. The venue is pretty small though, so maybe visit on the weekday to avoid the crowd.

## Day 5 - Off to Ottawa
And that is my Toronto trip...
