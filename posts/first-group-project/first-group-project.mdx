## Group projects suck 
There is not a single story I've heard from friends and other developers, where things actually ended up exactly as planned. I'm not even suggesting that perfection is the ideal outcome, but the ways that team development fall apart are usually the most predicable, pathetic, and painfully obvious in retrospect -- especially to an outside observer. Now extend this to undergrad group projects full of unexperienced computer science students, and now I'm wondering how the hell did half these people even make it past year 2. Best case scenario, the team is excellent, everyone gets along and productivity stays consistent, but life decides that life is too comfortable and fucks you over (like bricking your computer with weeks of unsaved work...). Worst case scenario, the team is only a team by name because some members go catatonic for days just to produce the minimal required amount of code slop, the others have manifested a quantity of passive aggressiveness able to silence the local high school with their fuck-everything aura, and like two other guys are yet to recover from their tragic coma since the first meeting 3 months ago. Honestly it would be preferable that our disappearing programmers were actually in a coma, it gives an actual reason to why their last git commit stopped at the second week of development.
<br/>
Anyways, I'm not here to debate the philosophy behind society or collaboration, nor complain about social media or vibe coding (despite my instinctual desire to slap the Instagram Reel brainrot out of my energy drink addict shaking, sleep deprived teammate). This is just me telling my stories of collaborative group projects, and passing everything I've learnt to you, the unfortunate reader who's made it this far, and now feels like they have to finish reading this blog. I would also call this a therapy session after the stress of surviving a computer science group project, but my bipolar sense of ego tells me that I came out of the experience better that the others, so obviously my opinion is better -- just trust me bro.

# Software Development 301 (how do i agile again?)
This was my universities introduction class to proper object oriented programming (OOP), the software development pipeline, and Agile practices. All the topics were actually relevant to what someone could expect working in a software company, so naturally everyone recommends CMPUT 301 as a must-take class for computer science. If only the class felt organized, or finally hire a competent tenure professor who doesn't bully the class size down to under a dozen ~~survivors~~ students. Regardless of the content side of the class, (it was fine), the lab portion is what won the reputation of the C.S degrees final skill check. 

## I want to drop kick Android Studio
Our grand final group project was to develop an Android app where users and organizers can host and join events, stored on a Google Firebase database. The first few labs were suppose to teach us the basics, but with how bloated and cumbersome Java for Android was, any deviation from the simple examples required a fun hour detour of gradle reconfiguration, even more boilerplate code, and/or yet another copy paste from the docs/AI with minimal understanding how or why that works. If Gemini wasn't integrated in Android Studio, I would have bashed it even harder for being so comically slow on Windows/Mac you might as well code with Notepad(++). Combined with the stress of 3-4 other classes, each with their own coursework and labs, everyone was already stressed and hella busy. Even still, there were some clean looking apps from great teams of six, so anything is possible so when working with the right people.

## It was not a great team of six
and it feels lame to blame anyone else, we were inexperienced developers after all. In this case, no one was necessary a bad "coder",  everyone made it past their first two years of classes above average, but strong technical skills doesn't translate to cooperative/soft skills needed for communication and teamwork. There is a fundamental mentality shift between solo and team development, and none of us were prepared for what came next.
<br/>
Me and a group of friends originally planned to form a team, but they also promised to team up with other people, who promise to team up with their other people. One thing led to another, and I end up teaming with mostly strangers and people I've seen briefly at school but never knew personally. Perfectly normal to work with strangers, it's a big world after all, but everyone else were already friends with each other and I ended up being the outsider among the group. This became an issue when everyone was communicating through personal DM's instead of the Discord group chat, and guess who wasn't using Instagram or Snapchat...

## Communication is hard
If there was any single takeaway from this group project, it's how damn important communication is to maintain, and how easy it is to neglect. It hurts even more knowing that I was one of the bigger contributors to this issue. The biggest enemy is assumptions, like assuming that everyone already knows what you've made and how to use it, or assuming that everyone read your random message explaining the code and instantly understands everything without questions. These assumptions leads to laziness, which for us meant that:
<br/>
- Meetings were never held weekly - "Too much effort and hassle"
    - This meant that most info was shared by text or DMs, and would often be lost, never seen, or forgotten.
    - Also without scheduled meetings, assigning responsibilities and tasks was difficult, nevertheless getting everyone online all at once.
- We weren't communicating effectively what work was in progress or finished
    - We never determined a central system to store and maintain updates, progress, and tasks. While we did have project management tools like Github and Discord, people were fragmented on what they used, meaning our progress became fragmented. 
    - Once again with the assumptions, we'd just send a message stating that something was done, sometimes update the project board, and move on. So often though this info was lost, due to our lack of bookkeeping, causing confusion in the group
    - As an example, after making functions to handle database logic, I would post a message in discord about what I've done and nothing more. Obviously when that message is pushed away and people miss it, that info disappears, and we end up with redundant work, and/or more confusion.
- Project boards weren't updated
    - Meant to assign tasks to be done, members including me, didn't mark off tasks once they were completed. Compounded with the lack of oversight or people even reviewing the board for new task, work was distributed unevenly and even incorrectly.
- We were merging code into main without enforcing code reviews
    - Okay this should of been obvious, but broken code was merged more times than it should.
    - Testing was also neglected, which while tedious, is still important work
- Documentation was only updated days before a deadlines
    - Undocumented code meant starting at unintelligible code and figuring out what it does yourself
- The discord group chat was just that, a single chat with no channels to organize conversations
    - and was probably why people were DMing each other outside the group chat.
<br/>
The end result of all this is a project where we'd just pick and work on tasks, the fact being missed by other people, the results of said work also being missed, and so we were always confused on who or what was even being worked on. There were issues with duplicate work, confusion about the whys and how to use said work, and someone getting away with doing (almost) nothing just because we never properly sat down and assigned tasks to the team. Needless to say, we sacrificed many, many hours, to compensate for our mess. 

## Reflecting (don't worry, scary android cant hurt you anymore)
At the end of the term, I was given a 4/7 by my teammate, primary due to lack of communication. Theres irony in that they never communicated to me that they wish I was communicating more, still I probably did deserve that low mark. Even after submitting the final product, my feedback also mentioned how many of the others didn't know and couldn't write down my contributions to the team. In retrospect, my long and detailed discord messages with nothing else to supplement it would obvious be lost, in fact I had to dig through months of discord history to remember what everyone else contributed as well.
<br/>
Thinking back to my original group of friends, the other group they split off into had similar issues of miscommunication and two members who did basically nothing. While apparently they were just really slow in finishing their tasks, it's also the teams responsibility to hold everyone accountable and assist in finishing work on time. Might as well try to keep everyone involved and working, no one is there trying to fail class (hopefully).  I get that, especially in junior year classes, there exist slackers who refuse to contribute anything to group projects, and their heads so perfectly tempting to slam into their IPhone 14 Pro playing hustle-maxers podcast clips on TikTok, but it's just not worth the punishment after the TikToker passes out from the head trauma, and suddenly your the "bad guy" trying to help the team escape the slacker with your "aggregated assault".
