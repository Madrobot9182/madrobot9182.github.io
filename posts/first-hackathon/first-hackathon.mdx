NatHack 2025 at the University of Alberta is an annual hackathon focused on hardware-oriented projects in Neuroscience, Medicine, Education, and the environment. This year, I got to compete over 4 full days of prototyping, developing, and pitching Focus Tree, by our team of 5, AttentionSpan.Ai.

This page covers my personal experience and what I learned this hackathon. [See my project page for the technical aspects of our submission.](/projects/nathack-2025)
