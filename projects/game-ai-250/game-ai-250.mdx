During a course on video game AI (Cmput 250), we used the game of Pac-Man to implement various pathfinding, clustering,
and procedural generation algorithms.

I love playing video games, where many genres of games hinge on competent NPC/enemy AI. It's an under-appreciated field,
but just as interesting as other AI technologies and C.S. in general. People often forget about AI in games, or how it
is (commonly) a separate field from machine learning and generative AI. These projects broadly cover the topics that
I've learned, with many more techniques not included:

1. Automatically generate a valid grid around abstract obstacles.

   - Then, culled the grid to generate a navigation mesh for more efficient path finding.

2. Programmed an A\* pathfinding algorithm to optimize finding the best path between destinations.
   - Up to 75% improvement in search time and space over greedy search.

3. Recreated the four Pac-Man ghost AI with a Finite State Machine.
   - Each ghost
     [has a distinct "personality" described in this blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20250119214645/https://gameinternals.com/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior).
     Each of their Scatter, Chase, or Frighten states was modeled based on their original and work interchangeably on a
     base ghost agent.
   - I also designed my own stalker ghost agent. They stalk Pac-Man from five tiles behind, and occasionally burst
     towards Pac-Man (at 1.5x speed) before running away. When Frightened, my stalker becomes a taunter, running 5 tiles
     ahead but never in eating range of Pac-Man.

4. Built a K-Means clustering algorithm to classify thousands of Pac-Man game data and predict churn (whether a player
   stops playing the game).
   - Efficient data structure to handle the multiple iterations of cluster improvements, processing thousands of
     datapoints each time.
   - This also required normalizing data such as hours played, total/average/max score, and number of pellets/ghosts
     eaten. Quantifying the data into one mean score for classification.

5. Designed a Markov Chain to procedurally generate Pac-Man levels.
   - Given a dataset of levels generated with certain "features", my Markov Chain determines these features to create
     similar levels.
