While pursing the certificate in computer game development at the UofA, I participated in a game engine class (CMPUT 350). We focused on rigeous memory and performance optimization in c++, engine architecture, graphics rendering, and common game features like camera movements and physics collisions. Both games below represents the two capstone projects, each implementing unique architecture and features we learnt and implemented ourselves.
