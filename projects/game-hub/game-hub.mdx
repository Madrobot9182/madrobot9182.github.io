When I was first starting out with React, I built a website that allows a user to search for video games.
[Check it out here](https://react-game-hub-dusky.vercel.app/)

It's a relatively simple and clean website, with icons for a game's platform, rating, and recommendation based on said
rating. There's a search bar on top, genres on the side, and dropdowns to filter out games by platforms and common
criteria like relevance, date, popularity etc.

This was a project I started to learn React and web development. Mainly it was to practice building responsive designs
with [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/), and fetching data from the [rawg.io](https://rawg.io/) api. Built it with
[vite](https://vite.dev/) and left it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for viewing.
