In my third year of university, I attempted the introduction class to software development (Cmput 301). An essential cornerstone for every future developer, covering object-oriented programming, Agile workflows, and team-based communication/organization. The major project for Cmput 301 was a fully fledged Android application developed by a team of 6. This class was also many student's first introduction to a major software group project.

The Cmput 301 experience transcends beyond a software dev course into something sacred, a rite of passage for those seeking the end of the C.S. degree cycle. Hence, I like to describe everyone's first time in a software team as a trial by fire, [see my aptly titled blog on group project and how my team barely managed to not collapse on itself.](/blog/first-group-project)

Pekkas is the name of our final application. It includes everything expected for an online social system, such as:

- User profiles with important information and profile pictures, stored in Firestore and Firebase Storage.

- Ability to waitlist for events by scanning a QR code. Users who are accepted will receive a confirmation notification to complete registration; otherwise, the app will reselect a new user.
- The ability for anyone to register a facility and become an organizer. Organizers can create and edit events, view the name + profile picture of users registered in their events, and randomly select X users if the waitlist is over capacity.
- Events store information such as scheduling, geolocation (via Google Map API), banner images, descriptions of the event, and an automatically generated QR code for joining.

- Organizers can send notifications to users about their events. Ability to filter recipients with certain conditions.

- An admin interface to moderate and delete content from the app. Includes search functionality and image browsing.

Pekkas isn't published on any app store, and I doubt an event hosting service with no active users would be practical. At least the project is still archived on GitHub with 700+ commits in 3 months.
